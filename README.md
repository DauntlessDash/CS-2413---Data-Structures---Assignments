# CS 2413 - Data Structures Class Projects


## Synopsis

This is a collection of my assignments I completed for my class CS 2413 - Data Structures. The class was a study of the interaction of data and procedural abstractions. Topics include creating lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs. And implementing algorithms such as searching, sorting, parsing, hashing, graph traversals.
