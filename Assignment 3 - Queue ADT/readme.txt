For this assignment I implemented a queue ADT with a Doubly
Linked List under the hood. The program operates using the following commands:

enqueue X Y

>>Assuming X < Y, uses a loop to push integers X through Y
inclusive onto the back of the queue in ascending order.

dequeue X

>>performs the dequeue operation X number of times.

peek

>>prints the integer at the front of the queue.

display

>>Displays the content of the queue from back to front.
