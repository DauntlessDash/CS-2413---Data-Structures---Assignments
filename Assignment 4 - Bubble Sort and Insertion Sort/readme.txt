In this assignment I implemented a bubble sort and insertion sort on a doubly linked list. 

Data is inputed and sorted as follows:

Num_0 Num_1 Num_2 Num_3 ... Num_(Num_0) SortRoutine

With Num_0 being the number of items to be added to the linked list and "SortRoutine" either being the word "bubblesort" or "insertionsort" depending on what kind of sort you want to do.


Examples:

10 10 8 2 4 6 5 3 1 9 7 insertionsort

5 10 8 2 4 6 bubblesort
